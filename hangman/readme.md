Hangman is word guessing game where you have given a word 
with blank spaces and you have to guess which letters can 
be found in that word and you try to form the whole word 
like this.

Now, everytime you guess the wrong letter, you lose a life
and hangman is being drawn. Once the hangman is completed,
you have lost all your lives and you loose the game.

So, guess the right letters and have fun !
